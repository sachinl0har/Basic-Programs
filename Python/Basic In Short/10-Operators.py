Operator Example Same As
=	    x = 5   	x = 5	
+=	    x += 3  	x = x + 3	
-=	    x -= 3  	x = x - 3	
*=	    x *= 3  	x = x * 3	
/=	    x /= 3  	x = x / 3	
%=	    x %= 3  	x = x % 3	
//=	    x //= 3 	x = x // 3	
**=	    x **= 3 	x = x ** 3	
&=	    x &= 3  	x = x & 3	
|=	    x |= 3  	x = x | 3	
^=	    x ^= 3  	x = x ^ 3

<<=	    x <<= 3	    x = x << 3



and Returns True if both statements are true	x < 5 and  x < 10	
or	Returns True if one of the statements is true	x < 5 or x < 4	
not	Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true	not(x < 5 and x < 10)

is Returns True if both variables are the same object	x is y	
is not	Returns True if both variables are not the same object	x is not y

in 	Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object	x in y	
not in	Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object	x not in y

& 	AND	Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1
|	OR	Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1
 ^	XOR	Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1
~ 	NOT	Inverts all the bits
<<	Zero fill left shift	Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off
>>	Signed right shift	Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off
